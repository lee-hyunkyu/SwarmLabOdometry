    We use a version of the high speed test (see OpenCV reference) to detect a corner:
    Uses the same pixels returned from the circle function. 
    Pixels are ordered according to the OpenCV reference (see the section titled: Feature Detection using FAST)
   
    Method:
        If the intensity on pixel 1 meets the threshold criteria, check if pixels 3 and 15 meet it as well.
        If those pixels meet the criteria, check if pixels 5 and 13 meet is as well. If so, it is a corner. 
        Repeat with every point returned from the circle function
        If none of the criteria is met, it is not a corner
        
        This way we check several points along the 12 contiguous pixel method detailed in the 
        Feature Detection Using FAST section of the OpenCV reference, which provides more accuracy
        while still maintaining the speed of the high-speed test, also detailed in the same section of the reference

    This does not reject as many candidates as checking every point in the circle,
    but it runs much faster and we can set the threshold to be a high value to filter
    out more non-corners
